            At <strong>Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR)</strong>, we believe that strong families create strong communities. The <strong>Urukundo Nirwogere Project</strong> was born out of this belief, aiming to <strong>bring peace, love, and stability to families struggling with conflicts and domestic violence in Maraba Sector, Huye District</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mb-8">
            Through this project, we walked alongside families in crisis, helped children return to school, empowered women and men to build healthy relationships, and supported struggling households to regain economic stability.
