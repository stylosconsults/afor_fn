          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">A Home Should Be a Safe Haven, Not a Place of Fear</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">A child's world should be filled with laughter, love, and the simple joys of childhood. Their homes should be safe spaces where they feel protected, valued, and nurtured. But for many children, this is far from reality.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">Across communities, too many children wake up in homes filled with conflict, neglect, and violence. Others have no home at all, left to face the world alone, struggling to find food, warmth, or a place to belong.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Some children go to bed hungry, not just for food—but for love and security.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Some suffer in silence, afraid to speak up about the pain they endure behind closed doors.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Some are denied their right to education, forced to fight battles no child should ever face.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="mb-6 font-bold">This is the heartbreaking truth we cannot ignore.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why It Matters: A Child's Early Years Shape Their Future</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">The love, care, and protection a child receives in their early years determines the course of their future. A child who grows up in a nurturing environment thrives, learns, and believes in their own potential. But one who grows up in hardship, without support, is left vulnerable—at risk of poverty, abuse, and lost opportunities.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">At Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR), we believe that every child deserves a safe and loving home. Through education, advocacy, and direct intervention, we are working to:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Reunite children with families and provide safe housing for vulnerable children.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Educate parents and communities on child protection and positive parenting.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Help children return to school and build a future full of possibilities.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Provide emotional support and mentorship, so no child feels alone.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Love Is a Right, Not a Privilege</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">No child should have to fight for love, safety, or a place to belong. It is their right. And it is our responsibility as a society to stand up for them, protect them, and be their voice.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4 font-bold">A safe childhood is not a privilege—it is a fundamental right.</p>
          <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Every child deserves to be heard, to be loved, and to know that they matter.</p>
          <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Together, we can build a future where no child is left behind.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">You Can Make a Difference</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">This is not just a mission—it's a movement. One child saved is a future transformed. And it starts with us.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Join AFOR in our mission to protect and uplift vulnerable children.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Support our work through donations, advocacy, or volunteering.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Be the reason a child finds hope, love, and a brighter future.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="text-xl font-bold text-center italic mb-6">✨ Because every child deserves more than just survival. They deserve to thrive. ✨</p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">A Family Should Be a Place of Love, Not Struggle</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">A family is more than just a home—it is where love, security, and hope begin. When families are strong, children thrive, communities grow, and the future becomes brighter. But for many families in Rwanda, deep struggles threaten to tear them apart.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Some families are trapped in cycles of poverty, unable to meet even their basic needs.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Some face constant conflict, where love is replaced with pain and misunderstanding.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Some lack the resources and knowledge to build a stable future for their children.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="mb-6">Without intervention, these challenges can break families apart, leaving children vulnerable and parents hopeless. But we believe in a different future—one where families are empowered to heal, grow, and succeed together.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Empowering Families, Transforming Lives</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">At Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR), we believe that strong families create strong communities. That's why we work directly with families in crisis—helping them rebuild relationships, find economic stability, and create loving homes for their children.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">Through our family empowerment programs, we have:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Helped 139 families resolve conflicts and rebuild trust.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Supported over 90 couples in legalizing their marriages, strengthening their commitment.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Provided 124 vulnerable families with livestock to improve their economic independence.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Trained families in financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and cooperative savings.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Encouraged 50 families to join family planning programs, ensuring a better future for their children.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">A Story of Hope: From Conflict to Unity</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">Before joining our program, Odette and Jean struggled with constant fights, financial stress, and hopelessness. Their children suffered in silence, and their home no longer felt like a place of love.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">Through AFOR's family counseling and economic empowerment program, everything changed.</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">They learned how to communicate and solve conflicts peacefully.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">They received a pig through our livestock initiative, which became the start of a small business.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">They joined a savings group, helping them secure their finances and plan for their children's future.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="mb-6">Today, Odette and Jean are not just surviving—they are thriving. Their children are back in school, their home is filled with love and laughter, and they are inspiring other families in their community to do the same.</p>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Family Empowerment Matters</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">A child can only thrive in a home that is stable, loving, and filled with hope. That's why empowering families is at the heart of what we do. When we invest in families, we:</p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">Break cycles of poverty and violence</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Ensure children grow up in safe, nurturing environments</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Create stronger, more resilient communities</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Be Part of the Change</h2>
          
          <p class="mb-4">Every family deserves a chance to rebuild, to grow, and to love without fear. You can help us reach more families, provide more support, and build a future where no family is left behind.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we depend on are at risk. Climate change is no longer a distant threat—it is happening now, affecting our communities, livelihoods, and the generations to come. If we do nothing, the consequences will be devastating.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-6">But we believe in a different future—a future where communities thrive in harmony with nature, where ecosystems are restored, and where sustainability is not just an idea but a way of life.</p>
          
          <p class="mb-6">That's why Authentic Family Organization Rwanda (AFOR) launched Greener Futures—a project dedicated to fighting climate change, restoring our environment, and empowering local communities to lead the charge for a sustainable Rwanda.</p>
